# What is Object-Oriented Programming

- we'll learn about OOP & it's 4 fundamental features

## What is OOP

![cheatsheet what is OOP](../notes-pics/14-module/3-lecture/lecture-3-0.jpg)
- it's a programming paradigm which is based on the concept of objects <br>
    & paradigm simply means the style of the code (means how we write & organize code)
- we use objects to model (means to describe aspects) of real world or abstract features
    - real world means Eg : user or todo list item
    - abstract features means Eg : HTML component or data structure 
- Objects may contain data (which is properties) & code (which is methods) <br>
    so by using objects , we pack all the data & the corresponding behavior all into one big block (i.e object) <br>
    & this makes super easy to act directly on the data & blocks are object
- in OOP , objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code. Eg : small applications on their own <br>  
    & we can use these objects as building blocks of our applications & make objects interact with one another
- Now these interactions happen through a so-called public interface which is also called API <br>
    & these interface is a bunch of methods which are used outside of the objects & can access to communicate with the object
- `why does OOP exist` : 
    - this paradigm was developed to organizing code , so to make it more flexible & easier to maintain
    - `spaghetti code` means code is not organized & makes hard to maintain large code bases <br>
        so that's why OOP is created
    - OOP is a most popular programming paradigm in large scale software engineering <br>
        but it's not the only one programming paradigm of writing organized & maintainable code <br>
        so one of the most popular paradigm is functional programming 

## classes & instances (traditional OOP) âœ…

- a class used to create a new object based on the rules described in the class <br>
    means it's like a architecture where the architect develops a blueprint to exactly plan & describe a house <br>
    but the blueprint (means a class) is really just an abstract plan like a set of rules <br> 
    but nothing tangible that you can actually touch . However , from the blueprint, many real houses can then be built <br>
    in the real world & with classes it's just the same ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

- Eg : we have a fictional model in the form of a class
    ![fictional Model of a user class](../notes-pics/14-module/3-lecture/lecture-3-1.jpg)
    - here we have a username , a password an email which is a description of data about a User <br>
        but User is not the data itself yet . Because remember , the class is really just a plan <br>
        & a plan doesn't contain the real world data just yet ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
    - & then we have the behavior which is associated with the data eg : login & sendMessage Methods <br>
        so this class has everything related to a user i.e data/description <br>
        & behavior all packed into one nice , self-contained block ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
    - now let's use that `User` class & actually create a new object/instance from this class like this 
        ![a new object/instance is created](../notes-pics/14-module/3-lecture/lecture-3-2.jpg)
        - & we inserted the real data about a user inside the object
    - so a instance/object is a real thing which was created from a class & a class itself isn't an object ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ <br>
        so a new object is created from the class like a real house created from an abstract blueprint ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ <br>
        now we can use this class to create as many different instances/objects as we need in our application like this 
        ![a new object/instance is created](../notes-pics/14-module/3-lecture/lecture-3-3.jpg)
        - just like we can build multiple houses from just one blueprint
    - & all of these instances/objects can have different with little bit similar or complete different data in them <br>
        but they all share the same functionality i.e login & send messages

## 4 fundamental OOP principles âœ…

- now next question is how do we actually design a class or in other words , how we model real-world data into classes <br>
    so these questions are just like an architecture student asking i.e how do we actually plan & design a house <br>
    so answer is there's no single way of designing classes , however , 4 fundamental principles <br>
    which can guide us toward a good class implementation ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

- `4 fundamental OOP principles`
    - `1` : abstraction 
    - `2` : Encapsulation
    - `3` : Inheritance 
    - `4` : Polymorphism
- & these are actually techniques that can also be used outside of OOP concept <br>
    but these fundamental actually define a core of OOP concept ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

- `abstraction` : 
    - means hide details which don't matter or relevant for the user
    - it's allows us to get an overview perspective of whatever we're implemented
    - Eg : we define a class which contain all the blueprint stuff to make a phone 
        - but user who is going to interact with the phone doesn't need that all the detailed stuff 
        - so those details have been abstracted away from us as the user & at the end , user will use simple phone <br>
            has home button , volume , screen , charge , etc which are related to view & interacting stuff 
        - so we're hiding those details which doesn't need for the user & those stuff are handled at the backend <br>
            which means we're doing abstracting the details which doesn't need the user like this 
            ![abstraction](../notes-pics/14-module/3-lecture/lecture-3-4.jpg)
    - abstraction is generally important in programming , not just in OOP . Eg : using addEventListener() method <br>
        we just simply used & we don't need to know how addEventListener() working behind the scene

- `encapsulation` : 
    - means keep some properties & methods as private inside only in the class <br>
        means they're not accessible from outside the class . However , some methods can be exposed as a public interface <br>
        which is API , so interactions b/w objects happen through a public interface
    - Eg : inside User class , we made the private property like this 
        ![abstraction](../notes-pics/14-module/3-lecture/lecture-3-5.jpg)
        - but in JS , `private` keyword doesn't exist 
        - we can't access those private properties & methods outside the class <br>
            but we can access them inside the class itself eg : password is important in the login method <br>
            so inside login method , we can use it ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ 
    - so we encapsulated & due to this , we prevent external code from accidentally <br>
        manipulating the internal state (means an object's data) & this is important because allowing external code <br>
        to manipulate internal state directly can cause many kinds of bugs especially in large code bases ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ <br>
        so we want no one else outside of the class to be able to use these properties & methods <br>
        & due to this , we don't make them part of the public interface
    - so public interface means is all the methods that're not private means they're not encapsulated <br>
        so make our code private makes easier to change our code without breaking code from the outside .  
        - Eg : if checkSpam() method was public then it could be used anywhere in our code & if we then changed <br> 
            the implementation of the method then it might break that code i.e replying on it 
        - so this helps avoiding bugs & spaghetti code ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
    - `Best practices for encapsulation âœ…` : 
        - we should always have the goal to encapsulate most of our state/properties & methods 
        - & only leaving essential methods as public ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡  

- `inheritance` : 
    - Eg : we have two classes i.e User & Admin & both of them have a lot in common
        - so if we create/design another class like this means two separate identities <br> 
            then we'll end up with a lot of duplicate code which is bad 
        - so here comes inheritance , so when we have two classes which are related to each other <br>
            then we can inherit one class from the other
        - means we have on parent class & one child class & a child class extends/inherit the parent class ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ 
        - so inheritance allows to reuse the same stuff in child class which has already has in parent class <br>
            so instead of writing the login logic twice , we can inherit from the parent/global class <br>
            & child class can have it's own methods & properties means we added some functionality <br>
            inside the child class ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ like this 
            ![inheritance](../notes-pics/14-module/3-lecture/lecture-3-6.jpg)

- `polymorphism` : 
    - polymorphism means many shapes
    - means a child class can overwrite a method which is inherited from a parent class <br>
    - Eg : so Admin & Author child classes both are special kind of users , so they both inherit from the User class <br>
        - now focus on login method , let's say an admin requires a different kind of login method Eg : a more secure <br>
            which has two-factor authentication & let's say we need a special login method for authors 
        - so how we can give them different login methods , so in each class we just write a `new` method <br>
            which is also called login method & according to polymorphism , that login method will overwrite <br>
            that login method (which is inherited from the User class) ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
            ![polymorphism](../notes-pics/14-module/3-lecture/lecture-3-7.jpg)
