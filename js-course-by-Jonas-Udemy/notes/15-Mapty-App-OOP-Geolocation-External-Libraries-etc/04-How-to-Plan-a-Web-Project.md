# How to Plan a Web Project

- most important ðŸ”¥

- in the real world project, it's very important that you always start with a planning phase <br>
    before building any project because otherwise you're setting yourself up to lot of confusion & problems down the road 

## About Project planning 

- now there are many different ways of planning a project , but we'll see Jonas's favorite process <br>
    which works great for many small & medium sized projects i.e `User stories` ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

- `STEP 1 : Planning Steps` : 
    - `STEP 1.1` : User story 
        - it means a description of the application's functionality from the user's perspective
        - & then the user stories put together will clearly describe the functionality of the entire application
        - so it's just a high level overview of the whole application means from which stuff user will going to interact ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

    - `STEP 1.2` : features
        - So "User story" allows to determine the exact features that we need to implement <br>
            in order to make the user stories actually work as intended

    - `STEP 1.3` : flow chart
        - to visualize different actions that a user can take & how the program react to these actions , <br> 
            we usually put all these features into a nice flow chart

    - `STEP 1.4` : Project Architecture
        - once we know exactly what we're gonna build
        - now , it's time to think about how we're gonna build it & this brings us to the project's architecture
        - so Architecture means how we'll organize our code & what JS features we'll use
        - so Project Architecture holds all the code together & it gives us a structure in which we can then develop <br>
            the application's functionality
    
    - so the goal is not to become software architect , the simple goal is to make a simply to stop & think about <br>
        about how we'll implement all this functionality before implementing 
        - so organization & making steps about what we're gonna do & how we're gonna do is important thing 
        - so we different ways to make that project 
            - `1` : we could have one big file with no organization at all
            - `2` : or we could divide everything into functions or we could use classes or use multiple files <br>
                or a mix of everything 

    - `why we need Project planning` : 
        - so the possibilities are really endless , so we have a lot of choice & all that choice can sometimes be a problem <br>
            & so if we don't think about the architecture of that project before writing the main part of our application 
        - then we'll end up with a mess of unmanageable spaghetti code

    - so once we done with the project's architecture which means we're done with the planning step <br>
        & ready to move on to the development step

    - & Note : doing `discussion` after these steps is the best way to clear more stuff before working on a project ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

- `STEP 2` : now Development step comes

## Mapty - Project Planning 

- `STEP 1 - user stories` :
    - user stories is essentially a description of the application's functionality from the user's perspective
    - So when you put all the user stories together then it'll provide a complete picture <br>
        of the application's with whole functionality 
    - now there're a lot of formats in which we can write user stories but the most common one is to write sentences <br>
        with this format like this - As a [type of user] , i want [an Action] so that [a benefit] <br>
        & by using this format , we answer the question who , what & why
    - `1` :  for the first user story could go something like this , as a user , i want to log my running workouts <br>
        with location , distance , time , pace , etc . So i can keep a log of all my running . <br>
        so if we analyze this sentence then this tells us who wants to perform which action & why <br>
        & based on this , we'll be able to plan the application's necessary features in a next step
    - `2` : for another steps , as a User , i want to log my cycling workouts with location , distance , time , etc <br>
        so i can keep a log of all my cycling
    - `3` : next thing , as a user , i want to see all my workOuts as a glance to track my progress easily over time
    - `4` : as a user , i want to see all my workouts on a map , so that i can see easily check where i work out the most
    - `5` : finally , the last user story , as a user , i want to see all my workouts when i leave the app & come back later <br>
        so that i can use the app over time 
    - by using User stories , we can describe exactly what the application will do ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
    ![Complete User stories about what he/she will do in the application](../notes-pics/15-module/4-lecture/lecture-4-0.jpg)
    - in real world , you'll be building the application from scratch on your own. so therefore , you'll really have to think <br>
        as if you were the user & put yourself in the user's feet , so that you can come up with these user stories <br>
        & then build your features from there

- `STEP 2 - Features` : 
    - so features will be based on the user stories
    - so based on that first user's story , we can imagine a couple of features that our application is gonna need
        - `1` : we're gonna need a map where the user can click in order to add a new workout <br>
            that's because the user wants to log the workout with the location . so the best way to get the location <br>
            coordinates is gonna be just clicking on a map
        - `2` : since we're working with maps , then we should probably use geolocation in order to display the map <br>
            at the current location of the user because this is a lot more user friendly <br>
            instead of the user scroll to their current position . So this is a perfect use case for geolocation <br>
            because even geolocation feature supported by browser & mobile
        - `3` : then we need form to input for distance , steps per minute (which is called cadence) , etc stuff
        - so form the first user story alone , we could already know that we need these 3 features <br>
            i mean , we don't really need them but they're nice to have because they allow us to satisfy the user story
    - & same process we'll follow for each user stories like this
    - & to persist the data , we're using Browser API instead of the database because we're building small app
    ![thinking about features for each user stories](../notes-pics/15-module/4-lecture/lecture-4-1.jpg)

- `STEP 3 - flow chart` : 
    - now let's put those features on the flow chart . so the flow chart should contain these different features <br> 
        which we're gonna implement but it's gonna contain how the different parts of the app interact with each other <br>
        which event makes sense to implement & also how data flows across the application
    - first couple of features : we need to implement in the flow chart 
        - i.e geolocation to display the map at the user's location & then to also display a map <br>
            where the user can click to add new workouts like this 
        ![flow chart : STEP 1](../notes-pics/15-module/4-lecture/lecture-4-2.jpg)
        - but think about why we put them like this on the flow chart , so whenever we start to build a flow chart <br>
            like this , then it's a good idea to start with events ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ , so in this case , I'm starting with the event <br>
            of the page loading & so that's always a good event to start on the flow chart because that's always <br> 
            the first event that basically occurs on any page . I mean it's not an event that we're gonna handle , <br>
            but this is the starting point where all the code that's in the top level will be executed when the page loads <br>
        - so when the page does load , we want to start by getting the user's location coordinates using the geolocation API
        - & after that data arrives , then we want to render the map centered on the current location of the user
    - second couple of features : 
        - then we need a form to input the data for cycling & for running , so we need to display a form <br>
            & we need the form to display/render whenever the user clicks on a certain position on a map  
            ![flow chart : STEP 2](../notes-pics/15-module/4-lecture/lecture-4-3.jpg)
            - in this flow chart , yellow boxes are the actions & the green boxes is when we render something on the UI <br>
                & red boxes are for operators which will happen async way
        - & don't worry about making flow chart because just like programming needs practice
        - Now , just to know in the real world , we usually don't always come up with all the steps in the flow chart <br> 
            in the planning process/phase , so it's fine to have a rough sketch in the beginning & then come up <br>
            with the exact detail during the implementation . 
            - So definitely don't get hangup on building the perfect flow chart because it's all about practice <br>
                because it's not important in the beginning so don't waste too much time on this so as you <br>
                become better with practice , this'll become easier & then you might be able to add more & more details <br>
                to your flow chart right at the beginning
            - but if you're just starting out without any experience & working on your first applications then don't stress <br>
                too much on this ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
    - third couple of features : 
        - we want to display workouts in a list & on the map too
        - so basically , we rendered the form in above steps already & then we're going to have an event listener on that form <br>
            so then whenever the user submits in it's own workout then it's gonna be rendered on the map & on the list 
        - & we want to store the workout data in the browser & then read that data whenever the page loads <br>
            & another thing is whenever a user creates a new workout , then that data will store all the workouts in local storage <br>
            so we're using that local storage API in the browser
        - & whenever the page loads, then on left side we'll get all of the workouts from the local storage <br>
            & render them on the map & on the list & this will only happen after the current location has been fetched <br>
            & a map has been displayed so that's what async means
            ![flow chart : STEP 2.1](../notes-pics/15-module/4-lecture/lecture-4-4.jpg)
            - so here the red box means it's an operation which takes time & only after it's completed then the rest <br>
                of the operations cane be executed which are depend on it
        - another feature , move the map to the workout location whenever we click on one on the workouts in the list <br> 
            so we need an click event handler on each of the list & when user clicks on any one of the workout in the list <br>
            then map will move to that workout's location
            ![complete flow chart](../notes-pics/15-module/4-lecture/lecture-4-5.jpg)

- so this is how our application is gonna work . So the features are need to implement using this flow/sequence <br>
    so this flow chart is just telling only one thing that what our program/app will do but not how it does it <br>
    so that's more specific which we'll figure out through architecture ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

- `STEP 4 - Architecture` :     
    - Now just like flow chart , we don't always need to have the perfect final architecture before implementation <br>
        so first we can do some experiment , play around with the code & only then think about the architecture <br>
        for the final project ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
    - & then we'll start to implementing features according to th flow chart & while implementing stuff <br> 
        if we need more organization then we'll do organization & ways to manage our data <br>
        then we'll come back to thinking about the architecture
