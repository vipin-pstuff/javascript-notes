# Project Architecture

- we'll talk about some architecture patterns in JS later on but in this small project , we'll use OOP with classes 

## Architecture : Initial Approach

- `Architecture` : means all about giving the project a structure , so in that structure , we can develop the functionality
    - so in this project , i decided that the main structure will come from classes & objects

- so to start , one of the most important aspects of any Project Architecture i.e where & how to store the data ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ <br>
    because data is the most fundamental part of any application because with data , <br>
    we can't have an application in the first place

- we need to store two different types of data , one for running workouts & one for cycling workouts <br>
    to manage which comes directly from the user stories i.e <br>
    ![need to store two different types of data](../notes-pics/15-module/9-lecture/lecture-9-0.jpg)
    - so we'll design our classes , so that they can create objects which will hold this kind of data like this 
        ![need to store two different types of data](../notes-pics/15-module/9-lecture/lecture-9-1.jpg)
        - so we'll be having a parent class i.e Workout & two different child classes 
        - Workout parent class will contain distance & duration in coordinates <br> 
            & distance , duration & coords are common thing that's why we put them inside the parent class
        - & both those two child classes contain their own properties & methods based on the type of activity
    - things related to running class
        ![need to store two different types of data](../notes-pics/15-module/9-lecture/lecture-9-2.jpg)
    - things related to cycling class
        ![need to store two different types of data](../notes-pics/15-module/9-lecture/lecture-9-3.jpg)
    - usually in the OOP , parent class comes above & child classes come at the bottom <br>
        - & inside any class , we first put properties at the top & methods at the bottom ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
        - & in the diagram , those triple dots means each classes can have more than just the constructor() function 

- that's all about the architecture of our data . 

## Structuring the code 

- now the rest of the architecture , it's more about structuring the code <br>
    which we already have from the previous lectures ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ . Like we have different events on the previous code <br>
    i.e the loading of the page , then receiving a position from the Geolocation API & in tradition sense , <br>
    on() method is not a event listener but we can consider it kind of as an event , we have click event on the map , <br>
    we have changing the input from cycling to running or from running to cycling , <br>
    then we also have the event of submitting a form

- so now we need to create different functions for handling those different events <br>
    & we're gonna do is to create a big class called `App` like this
    ![need to store two different types of data](../notes-pics/15-module/9-lecture/lecture-9-4.jpg)
    - `App` class will hold all of those functions as methods ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

- A Quick look at this `app` or application class diagram âœ… :
    - we can immediately see that loading the page which will trigger the constructor of the object <br>
        that we're gonna create through this class
    - so at the beginning , we want to get the current position of the user using the Geolocation API 
    - then as we receive that position, we want to load the map based on that position <br>
        that's why we're gonna have a method i.e Load map . Then as we click on the map , <br> 
        we want a method called show form 
    - then as we change the input , we want a method called toggle elevation field <br>
        & then the most important one is the event of submitting the form
    - then that new workout method (of App class) will be the heart of this entire class <br>
        because is the one that will create new Running objects or new cycling objects <br>
        & these objects will be built based on the data which is coming from the form <br>
        & as the user keeps adding running or cycling workouts , a new object will be created for each of the workouts
    - & each of them will be stored in a workouts array which will hold all of these objects <br>
        so this is gonna be an important class property that all methods of the class will <br>
        be able to use to work with those workouts . so `App` class is a structure which is to build the application itself <br>
        & organized into one neat block of data & functionality
    
- if the Project is quite complex then we can extend this architecture further & create one class <br>
    which deals with the UI & one class for Business logic (which works only with the underlying data)

- so in this architecture , we divide the application & data to handle stuff easily <br>
    & we used data encapsulation to protect the methods & not accessible from everywhere else in the code <br>
    that's why in diagram , we use the `_` underscore convention
