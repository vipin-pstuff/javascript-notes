# execution context & callStack

## Explanation - Execution context

- let's understand by assuming that our code was just finished compiling like this 
    ![just finished compilation](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-0.jpg)

- `global execution context creation` : 
    - now the code is ready to be executed after compilation , <br>
        now so called `global execution context` is created for the top-level code <br>
    - `top-level code` : means that code which is not inside any function <br>
        means only that code will come inside global execution context <br>
        which those line of code will be executed which are are outside of functions ‚úîÔ∏è <br> 
    - & functions should be executed when they are called which we already saw in pig game <br> 
        i.e we created init() function , so first time when that page loaded then we needed to call that function immediately <br> 
        in our top-level code like this <br>
        ![top-level come inside global execution context](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-1.jpg)
    - Eg : here we have a code like this 
        ![top-level come inside global execution context](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-2.jpg)
        - so here `name` variable declaration is a top-level code <br>
            so it will come inside global execution context & therefore it will be executed
        - then we have two functions , so whatever inside of these functions <br>
            i.e function body will only be executed when these two functions are called <br>
            but these two functions will be declared as a variable inside global execution context

- so a global execution context is created for top-level code but now what exactly is an execution context
    - well , an execution context is an abstract concept but it's like an environment

- `Execution context` : means is a place where a piece of JS code is executed <br>
    & it's like a box that stores all the necessary information for some code to be executed <br>
    such as local variables , arguments passed into a function , etc <br>
    - so , JS code always runs inside an execution context
    - Eg : let's say you order a pizza , so usually pizza comes in a box <br>
        or it might comes with some other stuff that is necessary for you to eat a pizza such as receipt <br>
        so that you can actually pay for the pizza before eating it .
        - so here the pizza is the JS code to be executed & the box is the execution context for our pizza <br>
            & that's because eating the pizza happens inside the box (which is the environment for eating pizza) <br>
            the box also contains receipt , etc which are necessary to eat a pizza (means to execute the code) üí°üí°üí°

- now in any JS project , no matter how large it is , there is only ever one global execution context <br>
    & it's always there as the default context where all top-level code will execute üí°üí°üí° <br>

- so here that top-level code is executed inside the global execution context
    ![top-level come inside global execution context](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-3.jpg)
    - & then functions also start to execute as well (how functions will be called inside execution context) 
        - so execution context will be created for each & every functions call & contain all the information that is necessary <br>
            to run exactly that function & same goes for methods (because these are functions also attach to objects) like this 
            ![top-level come inside global execution context](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-4.jpg)

    - so all these execution contexts together make up the call stack 
    - now , when all functions are done executing then the engine 
        will keep waiting for callback functions to arrive , so that engine can execute those 
        - Eg : let's say a callback function associated with a click event & remember , <br>
            that it's the event loop who provides these new callback functions üí°üí°üí°
            ![top-level come inside global execution context](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-5.jpg)

- `why execution context made & what's inside of it` : 
    - first : `what's inside execution context` 
        - `variable environment` : 
            - so inside it , there is a variable environment
            - so in this environment , all our variables & function declarations are stored <br>
                & also a special arguments object 
            - this object contains all the arguments that were passed into that function <br>  
                that the current execution context belongs to because each function gets <br>
                it's own execution context as soon as the function is called üí°üí°üí°
        - `scope chain` : 
            - so basically , all the variables (that are somehow declared inside a function) <br>
                will end up in it's variable environment. However , a function can also access variables <br>
                which are outside of the function , this happen due to the scope chain <br>
                so scope chain consists of references to variables that are located outside of the current function
        - `this keyword` :
            - & to keep track of the scope chain , it's stored in each execution context <br>
                & each execution context also gets a special variable called i.e `this` keyword
    - now these content of the execution context i.e variable environment , scope chain , this keyword <br>
        is generated in creation phase which happens right before execution üí°üí°üí° like this <br> 
        ![top-level come inside global execution context](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-6.jpg)
    - `important Note üî•` : for arrow function 
        - execution contexts belonging to arrow functions , <br>
            so arrow function don't get their own arguments keyword nor do they get that `this` keyword
        - means arrow function don't have the `arguments object` & `this` keyword <br>
            so they can use the `arguments object` & `this` keyword from their closest regular function parent üí°üí°üí°
            ![about arrow function in execution context](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-7.jpg)
    - Eg : working of execution context <br>
            ![working of execution context](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-8.jpg)
        - so we'll get one global execution context 
        - so here two execution context will be created for each functions i.e first() & second() like this 
            ![working of execution context](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-9.jpg)
        - inside Global Execution context , we have the variable name declaration like this 
            ![working of execution context](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-10.jpg)
            - here `<function>` contain the function definition body of their own function
            - & here `x = <unknown>` marked because value is the result of the first() function that we didn't run yet <br>
                so technically none of these values actually become known during the creation phase , <br>
                but only in the execution phase . so this is not 100% accurate
            - now first() function is executed & inside of it , variable `a` & `b` will be defined <br>
                & `b` variable needs second() function call for the result value like this 
                ![working of execution context](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-11.jpg)
            - now inside variable environment of second() function execution context , <br>
                contains `c` variable & arguments = [7, 9] will be passed when second() function is called like this  
                ![working of execution context](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-12.jpg)

- `why we need callStack inside the engine & what is callStack & it's working` :  
    - `why we need callStack inside the engine` :
        - now imagine there are hundreds of execution contexts for hundreds of functions <br>
            then how will the engine keep track of the order in which functions we're called <br>
            & how will it know where it currently is the execution so that's why here callStack comes

    - the callStack together with the memory heap , makes up the JS engine itself 
    - `what is callStack` : 
        - it's basically a place where all execution contexts get stacked on top of each other <br>
            in order to keep track of where we're in the programs execution like this 
            ![working of callStack](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-13.jpg)
        - so that execution context which is on top of the stack is the one that's currently running <br>
            & when it's finished running then it'll be removed from the stack/callStack & execution will go back <br>
            to the previous execution context
        - Eg : if you bought pizzas with some friends & each friend has a pizza box & then you put the boxes <br>
            on top of each other ,forming a stack in order to keep track which pizza belongs to each friend
    - Eg : `working of callStack` : 
        ![working of callStack](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-14.jpg)
        - so once the code is compiled , top-level code will start execution <br>
            & then a global execution context will be created for the top-level code <br>
            so this is where all the code outside of any function will be executed
        - now inside callStack , that global execution context is now at the top of the callStack/stack <br> 
            it's the one where the code is currently being executed
        - now here `name` is a simple variable declaration then `first` function & `second` function are declared
        - now in last line , things will get interesting i.e `const x = first()` , so `x` is waiting for result value 
        - so `first()` function will be called then it'll get it's own execution context <br>
            & stack on global execution context inside callStack & arrow pointer comes on it like this <br>
            ![working of callStack](../notes-pics/8-module/lecture-5/lecture-5-15.jpg)
            - now `first()` is the new current execution context
                - so inside `first()` function we have yet another simple variable declaration i.e `a` variable <br>
                    & this variable will of course be defined inside the variable environment <br>
                    of the current execution context not in the global context
            - second line inside first() function , we have `second()` function called , so now let's call second() function <br>
                now a new execution context will be created for `second()` function <br>
                & it's pushed on top of `first()` execution context
            - now execution of `first()` function is has been paused & we're inside second() function body for execution <br>
                & in the meantime , no other function is being executed . so first() function stopped at this point üí°üí°üí°     
                - & first() function will only continue as soon that second() function returns 
                - so JS has only one thread of execution , so JS can do only one thing at a time üí°üí°üí°
            - so inside `second()` function , `c` variable will be defined inside variable environment <br>
                & then `return c` will be executed , so `return` statement means that the function will finish it's execution <br>
                so execution context of `second()` function will be popped out from the callStack <br>
                & disappear from the computer's memory
        - now arrow pointer will come back to previous execution context of first() function <br>
            & that line will be start executed from where it was left i.e `const b = second(7, 9)` <br>
            - `advantages of having callStack inside the engine` : 
                - so this is how callStack keeps the track of the order of execution context üí°üí°üí°
                - `Note` : without the callStack how would the engine know which function was being executed before <br>
                    & it wouldn't know where to go back to , so that's why we need callStack <br>
                    because callStack makes this track process almost effortless
                - so the callStack is like a map for the JS engine because it keeps the track order of execution üí°üí°üí°
        - now that calculation will be done `a = a + b` & first() function also returns <br>
            so execution context of first() function will gets popped out from the callStack
        - & now arrow pointer will come back to global execution context where code is executed i.e global execution context <br>
            & the line of code will be executed where the first() function was first called <br>
            & the return value is finally stored inside `x` variable & the execution is finished <br>
            & the global execution context will also be popped out from the callStack

- so the general point is that code runs in the callStack
