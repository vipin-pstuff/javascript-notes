# Event Propagation : Bubbling and Capturing

- most important concept ðŸ”¥
- JS events have a very important property i.e a capturing phase & a bubbling phase ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ <br>
    if want to learn more about event then event propagation is the concept 
- `propagation` means travel further

## Bubbling & Capturing Phase

- here we can see all the parent elements of that red anchor element <br>
    & we'll simulate what exactly happens with an event when someone clicks on that link

- `Capturing Phase` : 
    - `1 Process : capturing phase` : 
        - let's say you clicked on that anchor tag directly & then DOM will fire/executed that click event immediately
        - however , that click event is actually not generated at the target element i.e anchor tag <br>
            click event is actually executed/fire at the root of the document i.e `document` object
        - & from the root of the document , capturing phase happens where that click or any event travels <br>
            all the way down from the document root to the target element (means from top/outside to bottom/inside) <br> 
            & as that click event travels down the tree , that event will pass through every single parent element <br>
            of the target element like this
            ![Capturing Phase](../notes-pics/13-module/9-lecture/lecture-9-1.jpg)
        - & as soon as the event reaches the target then the target phase begins
    - `2 Process : target phase` 
        - in Target Phase , events can be handled right at the target which we do with event listeners like this 
            ![Capturing Phase](../notes-pics/13-module/9-lecture/lecture-9-2.jpg)
        - so event listeners wait for a certain event to happen on a certain element & as soon as the event occurs <br>
            then that event handler fire/execute/runs the attached callback function
        - Eg : in diagram , when callback function fire/executed then alert() function will be called <br>
            which happens in the target phase
    - now after reaching the target then the event actually travels all the wap-up <br>
        to the document object again which is called bubbling phase ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
- `bubbling phase` : 
    - `1 Process : bubbling phase` : 
        - bubbling phase means that event bubble up from the target to the document root <br>
            means from bottom/inner to top/outer
        - & then that event passes from down to up inside the DOM tree through all it's parent elements <br>
            not through any sibling elements like this ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

## Why we're learning Bubbling & Capturing Phase & it's importance

- Bubbling & Capturing Phase are important because if the event is happened with target element <br>
    then that same event can also happened in each of the parent elements <br>
    means if we attached the same event listener for Eg: we attach the click event on the target element <br>
    & as well as on it's parent element let's say `section` element . so we have handled the exact same event twice <br>
    i.e once at it's target & once at of it's parent elements ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
- so this behavior allows us to implement really powerful patterns
- By-default , events can only be handled in the target as bubbling phase <br>
    However , we can setup event listeners in a way that they listen to events in the capturing phase
    - Not all types of events do have a capturing & bubbling phase. Some of them are created completely <br>
        on the target element , so that we can only handle them there
    - but most of the events do capturing & bubbling phase
    - event propagation means that event propagating from one place to another ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
