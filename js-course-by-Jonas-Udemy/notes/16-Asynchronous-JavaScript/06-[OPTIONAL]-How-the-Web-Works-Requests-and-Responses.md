# [OPTIONAL] How the Web Works : Requests and Responses

- understanding how requests & responses work on the web & how the web actually works behind the scenes

## Explanation

- so this is the diagram when we first talked about AJAX calls 
    ![diagram](../notes-pics/16-module/6-lecture/lecture-6-0.jpg)
- so whenever we try to access a Web server , the browser (which is the client) sends a request to the server <br>
    & the server will then send back a response & that response contains the data or the web page that we requested <br> 
    & this is the process works the exact same way no matter if we're accessing an entire web page <br>
    or just some data from a web API & this whole process is called the Request-response model <br>
    or the Client-Server architecture ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

- `going Deep explanation âœ…` : taking eg of the country that which we accessed
    ![about URL](../notes-pics/16-module/6-lecture/lecture-6-1.jpg)
    - Now , every URL gets an `HTTP/HTTPS` which is for the protocol that will be used on this connection <br>
        then we have the `domain name` i.e `restcountries.eu` & after the slash we have `rest/v2` <br> 
        which is a `resource` that we want to access
    
    - `STEP 1` : 
        - now that domain name , `restcountries.eu` is actually not the real address of the server that we're trying to access <br>
            it's just a nice name which is easy for us to memorize & understand 
        - but we need a way of kind-of converting the domain name to the real address of the server <br>
            & that happens through a i.e called `DNS` (domain name server) & domain name servers are a special kind-of server <br>
            basically like the phone books of the internet
        - so the first step that happens when we access any web server i.e the browser makes a request to a DNS <br>
            & then this special server will match the web address of the URL to the server's real IP address <br>
            & this all happens through your ISP (internet service provider)
        - so we need to know that the domain is not the real address & that a DNS will convert <br>
            the domain to the real IP address ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ like this <br>
            ![DNS converting that domain name of the URL into it's real IP address](../notes-pics/16-module/6-lecture/lecture-6-2.jpg)
        - & then after the real IP address has been send back to the browser like this 
            ![real IP address has been sent back](../notes-pics/16-module/6-lecture/lecture-6-3.jpg)
            - & we can finally call it , so this is the real address looks like 
            - so the URL will get from the server to client like in this form only <br>
                & it still has the protocol , but then comes the IP address & also the port that we access on the server <br>
            - & that port number is just to identify a specific service that's running on a server <br>
                so we can say that port number is a sub address ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
            - & that port number has nothing to do with the /rest/V2 resource that we want to access <br>
                so the /rest/V2 resource that will be sent over in the HTTP request which we'll see in later stage

    - `STEP 2` : 
        - now once we have the real IP address , a TCP socket connection is established b/w the browser & the server <br>
            & so they're now finally connected like this
            ![connection established b/w browser & the server](../notes-pics/16-module/6-lecture/lecture-6-4.jpg)
        - & that connection is kept alive for the entire time that it takes to transfer all files of the website or all data 
        - `what are TCP & IP` :
            - well TCP is the transmission control protocol & IP is internet protocol <br>
                & together they're communication protocols that define exactly how data travels across the web
            - they're internet fundamental control system , because they're the ones who set the rules <br>
                about how data moves on the internet ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

    - `STEP 3` : 
        - finally make our request & the request that we make is an HTTP request means Hypertext Transfer Protocol like this 
            ![HTTP request](../notes-pics/16-module/6-lecture/lecture-6-5.jpg)
        - so after TCP/IP , HTTP is another communication protocol & communication protocol means is a system of rules <br>
            that allows two or more parties to communicate
        - now in the case of HTTP , it's just a protocol that allows clients & web servers to communicate <br>
            & that works by sending requests & response messages from client to server & again back <br>
            Now a request message will look something like this 
            ![request message](../notes-pics/16-module/6-lecture/lecture-6-6.jpg)
            - The beginning of the message is the most important part called the `start line` <br> 
                - `start line` : contains the HTTP method which is used in the request , <br>
                    then the request target & the HTTP version ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
                - there're many HTTP methods , but these are most important one i.e 
                    - `GET` : for requesting/getting the data
                    - `POST` : for sending data
                    - `PUT & PATCH` : to modify the data
                - so an HTTP request to server is not only for getting data, but we can also send data <br>
                    now about the request target , this is where we told the the server that we want to access <br>
                    the rest/V2/alpha resource & now it's simply sent as the target in the HTTP request <br>
                    & then the server can figure out what to do with it 
                - now , if the target was empty means if it was just a slash then we would be accessing <br>
                    the website's route which is just `restcountries.eu` ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
            - Now the nest part of the request are the `HTTP request headers` 
                - it's just some information that we sent about the request itself
                - There are tons of standard different headers like what browser is used to make the request at what time , <br>
                    the user's language & etc
            - Now finally , in the case , we're sending data to the server. there will also be a `request body` 
                - it will contain the data that we're sending 
                - Eg : coming from an HTML form , so i.e the HTTP request 
                - & it's not us developers who manually write these HTTP requests but it's helpful to understand <br>
                    about what is HTTP request & also a response
        ![request message](../notes-pics/16-module/6-lecture/lecture-6-7.jpg)
        - `difference HTTP vs HTTPS` : 
            - HTTPS is encrypted using TLS or SSL which are also some protocols <br>
                but HTTP is not encrypted in terms of requesting & getting response ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
            - but request & responses will come same with HTTPS

    - `STEP 4` : 
        - so our request is formed & now it hits the server which will then be working on it until it has our data <br>
            or web page ready to send back
        - & once it's ready , it'll send it back using an `HTTP response` like this 
            ![request message](../notes-pics/16-module/6-lecture/lecture-6-8.jpg)
        - & HTTP response message actually looks quite similar to the request <br>
            which also includes same stuff i.e a start line , headers & a body like this 
            ![HTTP response](../notes-pics/16-module/6-lecture/lecture-6-9.jpg)
            - but in this case , the start line has the version or a status code & a message <br>
                so these status code are used to let the client know whether the request has been successful or failed <br>
                Eg : 200 status code means OK status , 404 status code means page not found 
            - then the `response headers` are information about the response itself <br>
                & there're inbuild response headers & we can also make our own custom response headers
            - last part is body , which is present in most responses & this BODY usually contains the JSON data <br>
                coming back from an API or the HTML of the web page that we requested ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ 
        ![HTTP response message](../notes-pics/16-module/6-lecture/lecture-6-10.jpg)
 
- here we just did the one request to that URL & one response got back <br>
    However in behind the scene , it's a web page that we're accessing then there will be many more requests & responses <br>
    thats because when we do the first request , all we get back is just the initial html file like this 
    ![HTTP response message](../notes-pics/16-module/6-lecture/lecture-6-11.jpg)
    - & that HTML file will then get scanned by the browser for all the assets that it needs <br>
        in order to build the entire web page like JS , css files , image files or other assets <br>
        & then for each different file , there will be a new HTTP request made to the server 
    - so basically this entire back & forth b/w client & server happens for every single file <br>
        which is included in the web page . However , there can be multiple requests & responses happening at the same time <br>
        but the amount is still limited because otherwise the connection would start to slow down ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ 
    - so when all the files have finally arrived then the web page can be rendered in the browser <br>
        according to the HTML , CSS , JS specifications

- `about TCP/IP` : now for the final piece of the puzzle, 
    - let's see TCP/IP & how this request & responses data is actually sent across the web
    - TCP/IP are the communication protocols that define how data travels across the web
    - `first part` : 
        - the job of TCP is to break the requests & responses down <br>
            into thousands of small chunks i.e `packets` before they're sent
        - once the small packets arrive at their final destination , TCP will reassemble all the packets <br>
            into the original request or response & this is necessary so that each packet can take a different route <br>
            through the internet because this way the message arrives at the destination as quick as possible ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ <br>
        - but if we sent the entire data simple as a big chunk then sending message can't be possible to send at the <br>
            destination which means let's say trying to go through dense traffic with like the biggest bus which is not good
    - `second part` :
        - the job of the IP protocol is to send & route those packets through the internet
        - so it ensure that they arrive at the destination using IP addresses on each packet ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
