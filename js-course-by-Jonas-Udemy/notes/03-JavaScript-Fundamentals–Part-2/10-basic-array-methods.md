# basic array methods

## includes() method

- `Note about indexOf() method âœ…` : 
    - indexOf() method return a index number of that element (which is inside that array)
    - but we have a modern method i.e includes() instead of using indexOf() method
    - includes() (method of array) is return true or false based on that element exist inside that array or not ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡
    - includes() method use strict equality for a check means it'll not do automatic type conversion ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡
    
- `use case` : 
    - we can use includes() method of checking conditions ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡ <br>
        & this is very useful use case of this method
