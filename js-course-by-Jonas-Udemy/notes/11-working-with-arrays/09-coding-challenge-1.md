# Coding Challenge 1

- `Ques 1` : Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners about their dog's age, 
    - and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing 
    - whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.
    - Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:
        1. Julia found out that the owners of the FIRST and the LAST TWO dogs actually have cats, not dogs! <br>
            So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat ages from that copied array <br>
            (because it's a bad practice to mutate function parameters)
        2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
        3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") <br>
            or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy üê∂")
        4. Run the function for both test datasets
    - HINT: Use tools from all lectures in this section so far 
        - TEST DATA 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
        - TEST DATA 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

- `what we need to do` : 
    - `1` : create a function which accepts those two arrays & that function will does following things 
    - `2` : create a shallow copy of julia's array & then remove the cat ages from the copied array <br>
        - we should copy it because it's a `bad practice` to mutate the parameters or the arguments of a function üí°üí°üí°

## solution

- `Ans Ques 1` : Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:
    1. Julia found out that the owners of the FIRST and the LAST TWO dogs actually have cats, not dogs! <br>
        So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat ages from that copied array <br>
        (because it's a bad practice to mutate function parameters)
    ```js
    const checkDogs = function (dogsJulia, dogsKate) {
        // here we're using slice() method instead of spread operator 
            // to create shallow copy of an original array 
        const dogsJuliaCorrected = dogsJulia.slice()
        // removing first element because it's a cat
        dogsJuliaCorrected.splice(0 , 1)
        // removing last two elements because they're cat
        dogsJuliaCorrected.splice(-2)
        // we can do this also dogsJulia.slice(1, 3) , but we actually want to understand the splice() method üí°üí°üí°
    }
    
    checkDogs([3, 5, 2, 12, 7], [4, 1, 15, 8, 3])
    ```

- `Ans Ques 2` : 2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
    ```js
    const checkDogs = function (dogsJulia, dogsKate) {
        const dogsJuliaCorrected = dogsJulia.slice()
        dogsJuliaCorrected.splice(0 , 1)
        dogsJuliaCorrected.splice(-2)

        const dogs = dogsJuliaCorrected.concat(dogsKate) // Ans Ques 2
    }
    
    checkDogs([3, 5, 2, 12, 7], [4, 1, 15, 8, 3])
    ```

- `Ans Ques 3` : 3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether 
    - it's an adult ("Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy üê∂")
    ```js
    const checkDogs = function (dogsJulia, dogsKate) {
        const dogsJuliaCorrected = dogsJulia.slice()
        dogsJuliaCorrected.splice(0 , 1)
        dogsJuliaCorrected.splice(-2)

        const dogs = dogsJuliaCorrected.concat(dogsKate) 

        dogs.forEach(function(dog, i) {
            if (dog >= 3) {
                console.log(`Dog number ${i + 1} is an adult, and is ${dog} years old`)
            } else {
                console.log(`Dog number ${i + 1} is still a puppy üê∂`)
            }
        })
        /* output : Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old 
                    Dog number 2 is still a puppy üê∂ 
                    Dog number 3 is an adult, and is 4 years old 
                    Dog number 4 is still a puppy üê∂ 
                    Dog number 5 is an adult, and is 15 years old 
                    Dog number 6 is an adult, and is 8 years old 
                    Dog number 7 is an adult, and is 3 years old 
        */
    }
    
    checkDogs([3, 5, 2, 12, 7], [4, 1, 15, 8, 3])
    ```
