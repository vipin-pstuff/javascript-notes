- using different array methods based on different situation
    ![cheatsheet of 23 array methods](../notes-pics/11-module/26-lecture/cheat-sheet.jpg)

- `points to keep in mind` : 
    - use those array methods which mutate the original array <br>
        because most of the time , we don't want to mutate the original array ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
    - map() array method used most of the time to loop over the original array & return a brand new array
    - most of the time , we use includes() , some() , every() array methods for checking condition <br>
        & these three returns boolean values which is very helpful in a condition like if else condition
    - sometimes we want to transform an array into a string , so we use join() array method
    - forEach() array method only used for looping on the array , it doesn't return any thing
