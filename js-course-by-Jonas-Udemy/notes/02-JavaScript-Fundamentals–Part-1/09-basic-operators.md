# Basic Operators 

## Example of power

- symbol used for power of is `**` ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
- Eg : 
    ```js
    2 ** 3 // means multiply 2 by three types
    // output : 8
    ```
    - so instead of doing like this 2 * 2 * 2 , just use power of sign 

- in programming , operation always start from left to right ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
- Eg : of operation 
    ```js
    console.log(20 - 2 > 20 - 3) // it's related to operator precedence rule ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
    ```

- `Note` : using this kindof combine `>=` comparison operators 
    - behind the scene , so when we do `if (2 >= 1)` then means we're checking two things 
        - i.e is `2 is greater or equal to 1` or not , so it's true <br>
            means 2 is greater than 1 but not equal to 1 , so one check is correct <br>
            so here inside this `if (2 >= 1)` , `2 >= 1` will converted into true <br>
            & then behind the scene it'll look this if (true) & this `if statement` will be executed ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
        - but if we write if (1 >= 1) , then 1 is not greater than 1 but it's equal to 1 , so it's true ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
