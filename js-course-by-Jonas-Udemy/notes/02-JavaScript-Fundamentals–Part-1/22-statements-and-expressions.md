# Statements & Expressions

- `expressions` : means at the end , that thing will return/produce something as an output 💡💡💡
    - expressions are like the words that make up the sentences
    - Eg 1 : `3 + 4` is an expression because it'll produce something <br>
    - Eg 2 : `1991` is also an expression
    - Eg 3 : `true && false && !false` is also an expression

- `Statements` : means like a bigger piece of code that is executed & which doesn't produce a value on itself 💡💡💡
    - Statements are like the complete sentence
    - basically we write our whole programs as a sequence of actions & these actions are statements

- & keep in mind about operator & operand ✔️

- Eg : if statement 
    ```js
    if (23 > 10) {
        const str = "23 is bigger";
    }
    ```
    - this if statement won't produce anything by itself , here if statement just simply declares is a variable called STR 
    - means inside if statement some actions will be performed like declaring a variable <br>
        but this if statement won't produce a value 
    - & here `"23 is bigger"` this string is itself is an expression
    - `const str = "23 is bigger";` is whole line is a statement because it doesn't produce a value <br>
        means anything which ends with semi colon that's a statement like a complete statement 💡💡💡

- ultimately , expressions produce values & statements is a full statements that translate our actions & don't produce any value 💡💡💡
