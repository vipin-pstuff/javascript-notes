# Basic Boolean Logic

- we have operators in basic boolean logic i.e AND , OR & NOT operators 

- AND operator i.e `&&`
    - in this both condition should be true then we'll get returned true 
    - & if any one condition is true then we'll get false

- OR operator i.e `||`
    - only one condition should be true to get true as a output

- NOT operator i.e `!`
    - to used to revert/convert that true thing into false 
    - & if that thing is false then it'll convert into true
