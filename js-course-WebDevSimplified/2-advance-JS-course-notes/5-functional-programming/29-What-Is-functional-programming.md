# what is functional programming 

- functional programming is also a another programming paradigm & OOPs also a another programming paradigm
- & generally combining both of them is going to make our programs much better
  
## what is the idea of functional programming 

- before going towards functional programming , first let's see the importance behind OOPs

- `idea of OOps paradigm` : 
    - OOPs means about taking concept & functionality that's related to a single object or model 
        - & putting it all together inside of a class 
    - so we're trying to separate out our program into individual models & objects & pieces of data 
        - & putting all of the functionality that relates to those pieces of data in one single class 
        - & then we have bunch of different classes that can interact with each other & all of the implementation details 
        - which are hidden away inside of those classes , it makes it so that using these classes & objects is a bit easier 
        - since all the complex + important implementation is hidden away for the user
    - so with OOPs we're trying to organize our code around how it's structured in the way that things related to one another
        - so objects are all related information inside of one class

- `idea of functional programming` : 
    - in functional programming , we don't need to worry about how data relates to one another
        - means we don't need to worry about objects or models & classes
    - so inside functional programming only really cares about when we make changes or mutations to our data or environment
        - & mutation is just a change of some form whether it's changing a variable value , storing data in a database , 
        - accessing some kind of external API 
    - so function programming is all about trying to make the least amount of changes & mutations as possible
        - so we're saving data to the database as least amount of times as possible
        - or we're accessing data from the database the least amount of times as possible ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
    - means we're just trying to limit those mutations & changes & trying to make our code as immutable as possible
        - which means that there's no changes at all
    - so functional programming is all about making as many as our functions & code as possible do absolutely no changes
        - & have no external reliances , so that way they're individual & on their own & they don't have any state to worry about

- now there's a bunch of different rules & tools that we use inside of functional programming to make it 
    - so that we do the least amount of mutations/changes as possible ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

## about functional programming course module 

- & if we heard about functional programming before , they we might have heard a lot of really complex terminology like monads , etc..
    - in this module , we're not going to cover all of these complex topics 
    - means we'll cover these complex topics but we'll not going to cover from academic or technical & jargon perspective
    - because they're super confusing 
    - so we'll go in terms of practical approach & it's become easy how to implement in our programs 

- & easiest & most important place to start with functional programming is `pure functions` ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
