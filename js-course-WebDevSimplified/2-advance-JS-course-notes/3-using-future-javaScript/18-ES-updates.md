# ES updates

- in this module we'll see how to use future JS features inside of our code & use those code in browsers which is not supported
- this module cover everything from how JS features actually get implemented , the process they go through
    - & most importantly what that means for us & how we can use these features before they're even implemented in our browser

## About ES updates

- we'll see a very brief history of kind of how JS works & update cycle of JS 

- `what is ES` : 
    - ES is ECMAScript is like a law of JS 
    - it's the specification of a JS 
    - & JS updates comes in the form of ES updates
    - as we know ES6 updates we use a lot in our JS 
    
- Pretty much 90% of the concepts used from ES6 updates

- now we get yearly updates of JS from ECMAScript

## TC39 Process âœ…

- [ðŸ”— ES updates gone through with a process](https://tc39.es/)
- [ðŸ”— ES updates implemented on browsers](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)

- so inside of this , ES updates go through with a process before adding any features officially in JS
