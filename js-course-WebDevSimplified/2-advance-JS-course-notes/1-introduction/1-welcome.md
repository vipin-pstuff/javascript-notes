    - we'll cover some more advanced features + some additional features like OOPS , functional programming 
      just kinda some programming paradigms

    - as we move into the second half of the course
        we'll talk about concepts which are not related to JS 
        but overall code related & general 
    - these are the stuff that we can use in any programming language 
        i.e security , testing , clean code 
    - these are most important sections of this entire course ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

    - these stuffs will push from junior level developer to mid-level developer
