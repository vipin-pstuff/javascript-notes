        - same for uncomment

## NOTE - of doing commenting âœ…

    - use comments for blue print before writing code 
        means make todo or steps + make test cases 
        that we're going to do to solve that problem
    - then write code ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡

    - always break the big problem into smaller chunks 
        & focus + solve those single small problems step by step ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡ 

    - comments make things easier to understand when you're working on a project
        & it helps to build the logic also ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡
