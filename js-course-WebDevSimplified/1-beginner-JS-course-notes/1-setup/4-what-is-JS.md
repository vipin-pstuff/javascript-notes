# What is JS

    - makes websites interactable 

    - essentially anytime that you're changing or moving or modifying our page in any way we use
        JS in order to do that and that's on the browser
    
    - JS is not meant to only modifying things but we can do a log of things

    - one of the most popular ways JS is used is in something called nodejs
    
    - which is a server side framework for running JS as a server but we can also run JS on the client inside of our browser
    
    - we can run JS on the backend/server in order to facilitates your request , serving out web pages
        or just doing anything you want with or just doing anything we want with that server
    - we can use JS on frontend and backend too and on top of that we can even create mobile & desktop applications using JS
        - eg : VS code is entirely with built with JS , slack , etc

    - technically is a scripting language which means JS is 
        very similar things like PHP , Ruby & the fact that 
        there languages are not compiled

    - so the code that we wrote in c , C++ , java , etc
        then that code is gonna be taken from what we wrote then machine does come computation
    - & turns it into machine readable code so that machine can understand

    - with scripting languages like JS 
        we don't actually convert your code means we take exactly what you write word to word
        & then we send it to computer * computer knows how to read what we wrote word to word
        without any compilation(errors) step in b/w

    - that's why when we're on a website we can actually view 
        the exact JS code that they wrote to make that website
        work inside of the browser

    - due to this things become easy , do & debug & 
        fix problems that we have in our website
    - because we can easily just view the code that we
        wrote exactly as it is without having to worry about uncompelling that code & trying to figure out
        what actually meant based on the compilation
    - that's a great thing about JS is that it's just whatever we write it's exactly what the 
        machine / computer reads in order to do the thing we want it to do
    - but other languages have to go through with unnecessary steps
