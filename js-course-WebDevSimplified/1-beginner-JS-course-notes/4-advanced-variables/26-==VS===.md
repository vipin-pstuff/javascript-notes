# == Vs ===
    
    - important ðŸ”¥

    - == -> double equalto sign
      === -> triple equalto sign

    - in last lecture , we talked about the weird things 
        around JS with type coercion words that
        automatically converting types for us which can be very confusing

    - here we'll learn about how we can avoid weird stuff 
        when we do checking for equality ðŸ’¡

## Note - weird bugs with implicit type conversion with == (double equalto sign) âœ…

    eg :

        const a = 1 
        const b = "1"

        console.log(a == b)

        - so here technically "b" variable is a string type
            & "a" variable is a number type

        - so JS converted "a" & "b" variables into both exact same type

        - so do we always want to do this type conversion
            answer is NO -> because generally we don't want this type conversion
        - because it can lead very really weird bugs
            like 

            eg : of the prevalent bugs âœ…

                const a = 0 
                const b = false
                
                console.log(a == b)
                // output : true

        - because so here JS did implicit type conversion
            means false is 0 & true is 1 and even 0 is a falsy values ðŸ’¡ 
        - so behind the scene JS converted 0(zero) into false boolean value ðŸ’¡ 
        - and value of "b" variable is already false ðŸ’¡ 
        - so false == false is true ðŸ’¡ 

## falsy values 

    - very important ðŸ”¥

    -> falsy values are : 

        - false
        - 0 (zero)
        - -0 (negative zero)
        - "" (empty string)
        - null
        - undefined
        - NaN (not a number)

    - if we see a value from any of these falsy values
        at the end will be converted into false boolean value ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
    - and any value if we see apart from all these falsy values
        will be truthy values ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ 

    NOTE : for empty string - falsy valueðŸ’¡

        - don't give a space inside an empty string 
            otherwise it will be no longer an empty string

    eg : of falsy values âœ…

        const a = "" 
        const b = false
        
        console.log(a == b)
        // output : true

## NOTE : of == & === 

    - very important ðŸ”¥

    -> == (double equalto sign)

        - means JS will compare/check only values of two variables with each other
          and if both values are same - return true
            if  both values are not same each other - return false ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
        - it doesn't check the datatype of the variables ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

        - it does implicit/automatically type conversion done ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
            means JS will make both two variables in same type automatically
            in order to compare & get true as a output

        eg 1 : of == (double equalto sign) âœ…

            let a = 1
            let b = "1"

            console.log(a == b)
            // output : true

            - here we got true -> as a output 
            - because behind the scene that "b" variable converted 
                from string type into integer type
                & then do comparison
            - that's why 1 == 1 is true

        eg 2 : of == (double equalto sign) âœ…

            let a = 1
            let b = "2"

            console.log(a == b)
            // output : false

            - so here we got false -> as a output 
            - because JS will convert that "b" variable 
                from string type into integer type
                & then JS did comparison
            - so 1 == 2 is false
            
    -> === (triple equalto sign)

        - means it will check/compare both 
            the two values of both two variables as well as 
            their datatype ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
        - if both the values of those two variables are same 
            and their datatypes also same each other 
            then we'll get -> true as a output ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

        - if only values of those two variables are same each other
            but their datatypes are not same each other or vice versa
            then we'll get -> false as a output ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
            because both values and datatypes of the two variables
            should be same then output will be -> true ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

        - it does explicit type conversion ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
            that we need to do as a programmer 

        eg : of === (triple equalto sign) âœ…

            let a = 1
            let b = "1"

            console.log(a === b)
            // output : false

            - because "b" variable is not in integer type
                that's why we got false
            - to get true as a output 
                then we need to do explicit type conversion ðŸ’¡
                
            // doing explicit type conversion to get true as a output ðŸ’¡

            console.log(a === parseInt(b))
            // output : true

        eg : of === (triple equalto sign) 

            let a = "1"
            let b = "1"

            console.log(a === b)
            // output : true

        eg : of === (triple equalto sign) âœ…

            const a = ""
            const b = false

            console.log(a === b)
            // output : false

            - but here if we use == (double equalto sign)
                then we'll get true 
                - because both is falsy values


## comparing b/w null & undefined with == & === âœ…

    - important ðŸ”¥

    eg : of == & ===

        const a = null
        const b = undefined

        console.log(a == b)
        // output : true
        console.log(a === b)
        // output : false

        - here we used == (double equalto sign) 
            & we got true -> as a output 
            because both null & undefined means nothing ðŸ’¡
        
        - but we used === (triple equalto sign)
            & we got false -> as a output
            because both null & undefined are technically different datatype 

    NOTE : of null & undefined

        eg : using === (triple equalto sign)

            const a = null

            console.log(a === undefined)
            // output : false 

            - because "a" variable is technically null
                not undefined
            - so datatype of null is object 
                and datatype of undefined is undefined ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
            
            console.log(a === null)
            // output : true

        eg : using == (double equalto sign)

            eg 1 : 
                const a = null
                console.log(a != null)
                // output : false

            eg 2 : 
                const a = undefined
                console.log(a != null)
                // output : false

            - here we're null is actually equalto undefined and null itself also ðŸ’¡
            - but here we're saying that null is not equal to undefined & null itself
                which is false

## Note : of != (not equalto operator) & !== (not double equalto operator) 

    - very important ðŸ”¥

    -> != (not equalto operator)

        - it is same like == sign ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
    
    -> !== (not double equalto operator)

        - it is same like === sign ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

    eg : of != (not equalto operator) âœ…

        - important example ðŸ”¥

        const a = 1
        const b = 2

        console.log(a != b)
        // output : true

        - but we do this 
            
        const a = 1
        const b = "1"

        console.log(a != b)
        // output : false

        - here as we know that != (not equalto operator)
            is same as == (double equalto operator) ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

        - so we're saying that 1 is not equalto "1"
            but behind the scene both values are equalto each other 
            but we're saying that they're not equalto each other ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
        - that's why output is false ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
        
    eg : of !== (not double equalto operator) âœ…

        - important example ðŸ”¥

        const a = 1
        const b = "1"

        console.log(a !== b)
        // output : true

        - here as we know that !== (not double equalto operator)
            is same as === (triple equalto operator) ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

        - so here both values are same each other
            but datatypes of both the values are not same
        - so we're saying that 1 !== "1"        
            which is true ðŸ’¡

## when to use === & !== operator âœ…

    - use === & !== operator
        when if we don't want weird bugs due to implicit type conversion
        amd when we're not dealing with null or undefined or both values

    - === & !== both follow the same rule

    eg : 
        const a = 1
        const b = "1"

        console.log(a !== b)
        // output : true

        - here we got true -> as a output 
        - because "a" variable is integer type 
            and "b" variable is string type

        - so !== -> means 
            - JS will compare both the values
                but not convert both values into same type
            - and !== (not double equalto operator) will not do implicit type conversion
        - so that's why datatype of both the values will not change  

## when to use == & != operator

    - use == & != operator
        when if we're dealing with null or undefined values
        and we want implicit type conversion

    eg 1 : 
        const a = null

        console.log(a != null)
        // output : false

    eg 2 : 
        const a = undefined

        console.log(a != null)
        // output : false

    - here we're saying that value null is not equal to undefined and null itself
        but null is equalto undefined and null itself also

## suggestion by kyle ðŸ”¥

    - very important ðŸ”¥

    - always 99% use === (triple equalto operator) and !== (not double equalto operator) ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

    - but if when we're dealing 
        with null or undefined or both values then use
        == (double equalto operator) and != (not equalto operator) ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
    
    - otherwise avoid implicit type conversion/coercion in JS
        by not using == (double equalto operator) and != (not equalto operator)
        and always use === (triple equalto operator) and !== (not double equalto operator) ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

    - so keep this in mind that 
        when to use === & !== operator and when to use == & != operator ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
