// üìù interview question 
// difference b/w break and continue keywords
/* 
    solution

        - break keyword terminate/exit from the loop
        - continue keyword skip from the loop
            eg :
                for (let i = 1 ; i <= 5 ; i++) {
                    
                    if (i === 3) {
                        continue ; 
                    }
                    console.log(i)
                } 

            output : 1 2 4 5

            - here 3 is not printed means 3 is skipped by continue keyword
