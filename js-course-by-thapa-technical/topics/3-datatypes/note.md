# Data types

- data type means which type of data contain by a variable

### 6 data types are primitive

    - undefined
    - boolean
      - true -> means 1
      - false -> means 0
    - number
      - for int value and floating values also
    - string
    - BigInt
    - Symbol

### NOTE for typeof
    - typeof 
        - is a operator to check the datatype of a variable
        - we can use it as operator but sometimes we use it
          like as predefine function also 
          - but it depends on situation
          eg : 
              var a = 2 ;
              console.log(typeof(a))
              // OR
              console.log(typeof a)
        - should be in all small letter

### NOTE for isNaN()
    - see examples in app3.js
