/* 
    question : difference b/w onclick inline event and addEventListener
*/
/* 
    solution : 

        we already seen but conclusion is 

        - addEventListener doesn't overwrite existing event handlers , 
            whereas onclick overrides any existing onclick event handlers

        - but use 99.9% addEventListener always
            and for little situation use inline events inside html document
